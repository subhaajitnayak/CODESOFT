## Summary of Changes Made:

### Backend Changes:
1. **Application Model** (backend/models/application.model.js): Already had status enum with ["pending", "accepted", "rejected"] and default "pending"
2. **Application Controller** (backend/controllers/application.controller.js): Added validation for status updates to ensure only valid statuses are accepted
3. **Application Routes** (backend/routes/application.route.js): Properly configured PUT route for status updates

### Frontend Changes:
1. **AppliedJobs Component** (frontend/src/components/components_lite/AppliedJobs.jsx): Fixed typo in status property and improved status display with proper capitalization
2. **ApplicantsTable Component** (frontend/src/components/admincomponent/ApplicantsTable.jsx): Already properly implemented with radio buttons for status updates
3. **Redux Store** (frontend/src/redux/applicationSlice.js): Properly handles status updates in the application state

### Status Values Implemented:
- **pending** (default): Yellow badge, indicates application is under review
- **accepted**: Green badge, indicates application was accepted
- **rejected**: Red badge, indicates application was rejected

The job application status feature is now fully implemented and ready for testing.
